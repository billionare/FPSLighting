TODO: 
	
	~ Make sure we have all of the SDKs we need
	~ Make a project board instead of this


CURRENTLY DOING / MAYBE DOING:

	~ Possibly adding glfw just incase we want to make a gui in the future (we could just use a windows form).
	~ Making tools class to add more functionality so we can eventually freely program without making any more functions.




DONE:
	
	~ Make github organization
	~ Make a project board instead of this




TOOLS:

	This is the gdi for taking screenshots of the game:
